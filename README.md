# IFT6755-Class_DiagramCompletion


A baseline tool for diagram completion
The goal of this repo is to build a proof of concept of a tool that helps developers to design their class diagram. 
The results are not expected to be very accurate but we are using this tool to understand better the specifications and the requirements of the system.
We now understand that some patterns should be respected while generating the concepts, (not repeated classes, no cycles, no related to code concepts should be suggested...) and we tried to tackle these problems.


Note that we also extracted data that suits the best our requirements. we had to define exactly our needs and perform some MDE transformations.
The link for the part of data extraction is the following https://github.com/meriembenchaaben/eclipse-RE-java-to-Ecore-to-csv
